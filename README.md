# Convex-Hull-Jarvis
Find the convex hull for a data cloud is very useful. Here is my implementation to find the convex hull in two dimensions with the Jarvis' algorithm. 

The language used in the implementation is [Julia](https://julialang.org/)

##### This and other programs are result of the subject "Computational Geometry" from the program of Physics of the UNAM (National Autonomous University of Mexico)
