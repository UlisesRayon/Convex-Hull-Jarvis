# Convex-Hull-Jarvis
Find the convex hull for a data cloud is very useful. Here is my implementation to find the convex hull in two dimensions with the Jarvis' algorithm. 

I invite you to run this code. There are a pair of examples [here](https://github.com/UlisesRayon/Convex-Hull-Jarvis/blob/master/examples.ipynb). 

__This code is not bug-free__, so take care, maybe in the future I update it.
Please, if you find a bug and you can correct it do it and help me and some more people. 

The language used in the implementation is [Julia](https://julialang.org/)

##### This and other programs are result of the subject "Computational Geometry" from the program of Physics of the UNAM (National Autonomous University of Mexico)
